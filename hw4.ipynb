        "## FAQ\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Do I have to use the scikit-learn data transformation pipeline? I think I can implement the transformations on my own and save myself the trouble.\n",
        "\n",
        "  With basic coding skills, you can implement the transforms yourself, but I advise against it for three reasons.\n",
        " \n",
        "  - Every key stroke of code that you type is a potential source of error. Some errors are readily caught by the interpreter. Others are syntatically correct, but have semantic errors. When you implement your own transformations, you have to verify that they are correct. Custom implementation increases the complexity of your code and increases the amount of time you must spend in debugging, testing, and maintaining your code.\n",
        "  - When you implement your own transformations, you must remember to apply them every time you are using the features to train or evaluate a model. When using transformations on the target data, you must remember to apply them when you are training your model, but you must invert the transformation to evaluate and score your model. The scikit learn transformation workflow makes it easy to link all of these behaviors so that they are applied whenever you fit, predict, or score a model. Implementing these transformations yourself increase the liklihood that one or more of them is dropped inadvertently when refactoring or updating your code. A dropped transformation can be a challenging bug to identify and fix.\n",
        "  - The simplicity of the scikit learn workflow, after you learn it, increases the probability you'll actually apply a transformation when you think you need it. If you had to implement your own transformation or go find some old code where you had previously implemented something similar, you're less likely to implement a transformation in marginal cases. You're even less likely to try several transformations to compare performance. ON the other hand, if you learn the scikit learn workflow, you're more likely to apply a transformation and possibly compare the results of several transformations.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Help! I just realized it will take _6 years_ to run my hyperparameter search.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Welcome to ***Dimensionality's Curse!*** Though you can potentially speed things up by parallelizing the problem, assigning parts of the analysis to different processors, but the run time of your problem will grow much faster with increases in dimensionality than you'll be able to reduce it by incorporating more processors. By way of example, consider the following set of options:\n",
        "\n",
        "  - 2 model options: Linear and ElasticNet\n",
        "  - 10-fold cross-validation\n",
        "  - 8 options for ElasticNet alpha\n",
        "  - 10 options for ElasticNet 1l_ratio \n",
        "  - 22 features with best subset selection\n",
        "\n",
        "  The above options will require evaluating 3,355,443,200 models. Even if it takes just 0.008 seconds to evaluate a single model, it will take nearly 27 million hours to consider every possible model created by the combinations above.\n",
        "  - Linear: 10 * 4,194,304 = 41,943,040\n",
        "  - ElasticNet: 10 * 8 * 10 * 4,194,304 = 3,355,443,200\n",

        "3. What are some ways that I can reduce the number of models I have to fit?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - If looking at best subsets of features, rather than considering the complete powerset of features, consider those that are correlated with salary. Consider using a [correlation heat map](https://colab.research.google.com/github/afit-csce623-master/demos/blob/main/demo_RFECV.ipynb#scrollTo=b9jMDC2P3s_l&line=1&uniqifier=1) to identify candidate features. Remember that both positive and negative values are potentially meaningful. The key attribute in correlation is distance to zero / closeness to either -1.0 or 1.0.\n",
        "  - Reduce the space of feature values over which you're searching on the basis of other searches. For example, consider limiting the features you examine to those kept by RFECV.
